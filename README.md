# Hidden Search

https://thedanitor.github.io/hidden_search/

This project is from the Day 4 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have heavily commented the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what each line of code does.


### Overall Impression

Very simple, yet satisfying search widget. Another good application using concepts covered in the previous projects.

### Things Learned

* classList.toggle() can be used to add/remove classes
* .focus() method used to bring element into focus
